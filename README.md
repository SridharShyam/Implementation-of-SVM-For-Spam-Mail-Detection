# Implementation-of-SVM-For-Spam-Mail-Detection

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the SVM For Spam Mail Detection.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. import neccessary libraries required.
2. Load the dataset using pd.read_csv.
3. Use CountVectorizer to convert text data into a matrix of token counts.
4. Create an SVM model with a linear kernel.
5. print the accuracy and classification report.

## Program:
```
